# ChurnPrediction
## Overview
This is a project to determine which customers with certain features are likely to churn. The features are determined by demographics and customers' bank account information. I am using several machine learning models to improve the accuracy performance as well as hyperparameter tuning. The data from this project are obtained from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhammeshram579/bank-customer-churn-prediction).
